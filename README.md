# Serial Monitor Cli

## Sending JSON commands

To send commands to the serial device you will write them to the console. The CLI expects command in the format below:

{"cmd": "write", "payload": "hello world"}
{"cmd": "close"}

The payload field is only required for the write command.

### Setting Up Dev Environment

- Create Python 3.8 Virtual Environment
	```cmd
	python -m venv ./.venv
	```
- Activate environment and install dependecies
	```cmd
	.venv\Script\Activate
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```

### Dev Dependecies

- A device that can connect to a serial port (e.g. Arduino Uno)
- Sample Arduino Code for test device:
    ```C++
    int i = 0;

    void setup() {
        Serial.begin(9600);
    }

    void loop() {
        Serial.println(i);
        i++;
        delay(1000);
    }
    ```
### Setting up the debugger

1. Connect your test device to you computer
1. Run `python main.py --list-ports` to find which port your device is connected to
1. Open `launch.json` in `.vscode`
1. Edit args to match the current port: 
    > "args": ["open", "{your-port-here}", "-b 9600"]
1. Press F5 to start debugging

### Building the Code
```cmd
pyinstaller .\src\main.py --onefile
```
